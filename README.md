# WordSearch
> This Java program uses object oriented programming to run a game where two players take turns finding the most words that occur on a given board. Twelve different boards are given as CSV files for the users to play on. The main class randomly selects one of the twelve boards for the game. There are four classes: WordSearchLauncher, WordSearchPlayers, WordSearchGuessGame, and WordSearchBoard. The WordSearchLauncher is the main driver class that runs the program. The WordSearchLauncher class is the main class that starts the game. The WordSearchPlayers class stores each player's score and guessed words and the total number of guessed words from both players. The WordSearchGuessGame class contains objects of the WordSearchBoard and WordSearchPlayers classes; two player objects are created, the initial board is printed, and the players input their guesses. The WordSearchBoard class randomizes the board to be used, updates the board as the players guess, validates the players' inputs, and checks the board for the words in several different orientations.
